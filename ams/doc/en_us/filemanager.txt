Functions:
---------
1. The module allows to copy, move, delete, rename files and folders. 
Working directories/var/lib/asterisk as ' Asterisk Libs' and/var/lib/asterisk/sounds as ' Asterisk Sounds' are originally set. 
You can edit parameter $filemanager_dirs in a file config.php. 
The web-server should have corresponding access rights to files in these folders. 
For this purpose it is possible execute a following command: 

shell> chown-R nobody:nobody/var/lib/asterisk 

Instead of nobody substitute a name of the user on behalf of which your web-server works. 

2. Look through and edit (depending on type of a file) text, pdf, etc. files. 

3. To receive the detailed information on a file.
