"The number you are trying to use, %s, is currently available from one of the "
"DUNDi routes you have configured on your system. As a result you cannot use "
"this number on this system. Even if the route configuration does not pass "
"this number you will still be blocked from creating it. If this is not an "

"setup, disable the DUNDi trunk in question, or disable this module to avoid "
"the checks. Otherwise, remove %s from the remote system before creating this "
