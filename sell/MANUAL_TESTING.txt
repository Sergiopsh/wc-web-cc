= Rationale =

Testing all the application using only regression testing is not possible due to constraints on development time.

So some tests are executed using regression tests and other manually before releasing a new version.

= Initial Pass =

Load demo data using:

  cd scripts
  sh make_regression_testing

= Localizations =

Execute the application using different locales and check if there are missing trnaslations.

= Application Test =

Load demo data and perform various tests on application behaviour:
  * check if CDR-LIST is updated respect CALL REPORT;
  * various filters on CALL REPORT;
  * export data to CSV;
  * test if automatic evaluation of calls is executed correctly;
  * insert conflicting rates and test if there are errors;
