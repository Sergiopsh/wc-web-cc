### Fast Invoice Generation / Regeneration

You can generate invoices for every customer with calls in a given time-frame using the **Invoice Creations** module instead of this module.

### Invoice Update

If you change the cost of calls already invoiced then the invoice is not updated. 

You can force a regeneration of an invoice using the **Regenerate Invoice** button wich is displayed in the edit form of an invoice.
