### Cost vs Income

Every call has a cost and an income because Asterisell views you (the VoIP service provider) as a reseller of others vendors services. 

The income is what your customer pays to you and the cost is what you pays to other vendors in order to route the customer call.

Each call when rated must have a definite income and cost. If there is no rate to apply or more than a rate then the call is not rated and an error is signaled to the Asterisell administrator. The administrator can freely correct the problem updating the rate table.
