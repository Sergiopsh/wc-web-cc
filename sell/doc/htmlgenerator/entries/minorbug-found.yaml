  "A non critical bug":http://code.google.com/p/asterisell/issues/detail?id=1 was found. 

  I will fix it only if there will be a "free donation or a buy of a commercial version.":paid-support.html 

  Up to date I'm developing an improved "asterisell-testing-3.0.0" release, for my main customer. He is still using "asterisell-stable-0.9.12", that is not affected from the bug.
